Part 1: Fundamentals

a. With Readme

1. Create new repository
2. Clone/download using https.
3. In cmd, go to the target folder
4. Create a folder using repository link with command "git clone https:...."
5. Windows - dir
6. View Readme content with command type README.md
7. Create a file using notepad git_inst.txt
8. Add to repository using - git add git_inst.txt
9. Check status using -  git status
10. Commit changes using - git commit -m "mesg here"
11. Push the file to remote repository using - git push

B. Without readme

1. mkdir new_folder
2. cd new_folder
3. echo "# new_folder >> README.md
4. git init - Initialize the folder/dir
5. git add README.txt
6. git status
7. git commit -m "msg here"
8. git remote add origin SSHRepository/HTTPS repository link
9. git push -u origin master


Part 2: Creating branches

1. Let's say there is a remote file that somebody else pushed,
   Use command - git pull
2. To add a branch in master branch - git branch branchname
3. Switch the branch - git checkout branchname
4. Adding a file in the branch - echo "#content">> filename.txt
5. To create branch remotely - git push --set-upstream origin branchname
6. Switch branch to master again using - git checkout master
7. Merge the branches - git merge mybranch - This happens locally. To merge in remote, you should push


Part 3: Fork a repository and create pull request


Why to fork?

If you cannot get a commit right to that repository, then create a fork and then pull request.

1. Click fork and copy the repository in your account
2. Copy SSH rep link and clone - git clone yoursshrepolink
3. Edit files that you want
4. git add .
5. git commit -m "message"
6. git push
7. Create a pull request to make changes in the original file.


Creating SSH keys
